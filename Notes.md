## NodeJS

**NodeJS** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript library and runtime environment. 

You can use it to run web apps outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed Node.js in 2009, and the latest version, v18, was released in October 2022. 

This IDE is used to ***develop server-side web apps***, and since it uses an ***asynchronous, event-driven model***, it is the best option for creating data-intensive apps.

The **NPM** â€“ *Node Package Manager* is the default package manager for NodeJs. Basically, NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime environment, allowing developers to develop the scalable application in a given time.
